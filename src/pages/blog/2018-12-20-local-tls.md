A huge part of sales engineering is doing demos. One of the things
I demo a lot is Spring Boot. Regardless of the feature I'm showing
off, I want to make sure I'm showing best practices that my 
audience can bring to their work. One of these practices is using
TLS everywhere.

In contrast, I also want my demonstrations to be able to run 
locally on my laptop. You never know when something's going to go
wrong with the network and being able to work self-contained is
a big plus. Boot apps run great locally, but by default they're
going to be in-the-clear HTTP on port 8080. That's not a best 
practice I want to encourage.

This is a tradeoff that's not too hard to accept, but I wanted
to see if I could easily avoid it. Self-signed certs are an option,
but cause an extra headache managing trust relationship. 

I use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) for certificates 
for all of my public-facing work. They won't issue me a certificate 
for `localhost` (nor should they). But they'll issue one for any
subdomain that I own, and they issue wildcards. There's something
I can work with.

With a domain I own, I can map any address to `127.0.0.1`. To make
this simple, I pointed `*.local.crdant.io` to `127.0.0.1` and then
used `certbot` to create one wildcard certificate I can use for 
all my local demos.

```shell
$ export DOMAIN=local.crdant.io
$ certbot certonly --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
    --certname ${DOMAIN} --domain '*.${DOMAIN}' \
    --config-dir /usr/local/etc/certbot \
    --work-dir /usr/local/var/certbot \
    --logs-dir /usr/local/var/log \
    --dns-google --dns-google-propagation-seconds 120 \
    --dns-google-credentials $GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON
```

and then create a PKCS12 file for it

```shell
$ export KEY_FILE=/usr/local/etc/certbot/live/${DOMAIN}/privkey.pem
$ export CERT_FILE=/usr/local/etc/certbot/live/${DOMAIN}/fullchain.pem
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -name local -in $CERT_FILE -inkey $KEY_FILE \
    -out /usr/local/etc/certbot/live/${DOMAIN}/certificate.p12
```

I can then point a Spring Boot application that I'm running locally 
to that PKCS12 file and use TLS across all of my demos. It only takes
a couple of lines in `bootstrap.yml`.

```java
server:
  ssl:
    key-store: /usr/local/etc/certbot/live/local.crdant.io/certificate.p12
    keyStoreType: PKCS12
    keyAlias: local
    key-store-password: numb-avaunt-barbados-pelt
```
